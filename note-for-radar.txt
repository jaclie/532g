We created a radar chart in Figma and exported the code to use in our project. However, the code for the radar chart has a limited time period each time we use it, meaning we have to export the code from Figma again. As a result, it may not always be visible on the current website when you visit. Therefore, please refer to our report (Fig.2 Radar Chart of Game Statistics & Wave Chart of Score Lead by Quarter) for a detailed view.
